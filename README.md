===================================

This repository was established for the World-Bank-sponsored training

Policy Research Unit (TPRU) in the Ministry of Finance.  The training
sessions extended through June 2019.  This repository, which is called
`taxdata` and is owned by the GitHub organizaton called `TPRU-India`,

Getting Started
---------------

If you want to **propose code changes**, follow the directions in the
[USA Tax-Calculator Contributor
Guide](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tax-calculator-contributor-guide)
on how to clone the TPRU-India taxcalc git repository.  Before developing
any code changes be sure to read completely the Contributor Guide and
then read about our [coding
style](https://github.com/TPRU-India/taxcalc/blob/master/CODING.md#coding-style)
and [testing
procedures](https://github.com/TPRU-India/taxcalc/blob/master/TESTING.md#testing-procedures).
You may find this [git cheat
sheet](https://github.com/TPRU-India/taxcalc/blob/master/SIMPLE_GIT_USAGE.md#simple-git-usage)
useful in preparing a GitHub pull request that contains your proposed
code changes.  The step-by-step workflow used to create and modify a
new pull request has been documented for the USA Tax-Calculator in this
[workflow document](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/WORKFLOW.md#tax-calculator-pull-request-workflow).

The taxcalc [release
history](https://github.com/TPRU-India/taxcalc/blob/master/RELEASES.md#taxcalc-release-history)
provides a high-level summary of past development work.
