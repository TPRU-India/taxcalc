Tax Microsimulation Model for India
===================================

This repository was established for the World-Bank-sponsored training
sessions that began during September 2018 in New Delhi at the Tax
Policy Research Unit (TPRU) in the Ministry of Finance.  The training
sessions extended through June 2019.  This repository, which is called
`taxdata` and is owned by the GitHub organizaton called `TPRU-India`,
is now managed by TPRU.

Getting Started
---------------

If you want to **propose code changes**, follow the directions in the
[USA Tax-Calculator Contributor
Guide](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/docs/contributing/contributor_guide.md#contributor-guide)
on how to clone the TPRU-India taxcalc git repository.  Before developing
any code changes be sure to read completely the Contributor Guide and
then read about our [coding
style](https://github.com/TPRU-India/taxcalc/blob/master/CODING.md#coding-style)
and [testing
procedures](https://github.com/TPRU-India/taxcalc/blob/master/TESTING.md#testing-procedures).
You may find this [git cheat
sheet](https://github.com/TPRU-India/taxcalc/blob/master/SIMPLE_GIT_USAGE.md#simple-git-usage)
useful in preparing a GitHub pull request that contains your proposed
code changes.  The step-by-step workflow used to create and modify a
new pull request has been documented for the USA Tax-Calculator in this
[workflow document](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/docs/contributing/pr_workflow.md#contributor-guide).

The taxcalc [release
history](https://github.com/TPRU-India/taxcalc/blob/master/RELEASES.md#taxcalc-release-history)
provides a high-level summary of past development work.
